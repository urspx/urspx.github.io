a number of people discover the link between statistics (data gathering) and the constitution of the (nation) state, esp. in the 19th century - however, foucault places the stress on the creation of subjects: the mass (biopower), i.e., an aggregated body and individual (discipline), i.e., an atomized body. note that re: mass, he still talks about a mass-*ified* body, grounding the conception of the body itself in disicpline, atomization, and individuation (check fr). deleuze w/ control opens a new question - creation of which subjects? (data streams, nomadic subjects... lines of flight(and their relation to a certain stream, a certain segmentation)?)
