When viewed next to the disciplinary technology of power, biopolitical administration introduces two new effects, on the basis of which it opens up the possibility of *control society*. The particular character of these emerges (?) and becomes most evident in when viewed in contrast to disciplinary society.

The first of these is a process of *abstraction* with regards to the subjects that discipline forms. An integrated disciplinary society replicates throughout the social body a hierarchical distribution of in/exclusionary surveillance systems, at the final level of which power comes to bear on individual bodies. When Foucault explains that the 'the prison becomes the model for society' (FIX&CITE), he describes how the layout of watcher and watched is reproduced at every other social site, thereby ensuring that, throughout the whole of society, bodies are exposed to a regulated gaze.

The distribution of this system relies on a binary system of segmentation, i.e., the establishment of a geography/topography (?), over which individual subjects move. As Deleuze writes, in this system one is always within an institution: the school, the army, the factory, the university, the workplace, etc... Even though certain institutions exist in parallel to this flow (the family and the church), they are nevertheless delineated from the others, and explicit rules govern this distinction: the liberal separations of church and state, public and private.
