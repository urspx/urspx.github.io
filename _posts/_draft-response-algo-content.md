Recently a post written by James Bridle, "Something is Wrong on the Internet" stirred up discussion. It discusses a segment of YouTube in which videos for children are mass-produced, essentially by algorithm, and often feature shocking – that is, violent or disturbing – content. He describes this apparatus as one of "Industrialised nightmare production."

The post brought forth a fair amount of discussion. Geoff Manaugh had one of the more interesting replies; unlike Bridle, who seems to be worried primarily about the _content_ and _production_ of the videos, he expressed concern over "how they suggest kids should think". To quote his primary concern:

>They replace narrative reason with algorithmic recommendation, connecting events and objects in weird, illogical bursts lacking any semblance of internal coherence, where the sudden appearance of something completely irrelevant can nonetheless be explained because of its keyword-search frequency. Having a conversation with someone who thinks like this—who “thinks” like this—would be utterly alien, if not logically impossible.
